# Blogging-website
A simple, responsive blogging website created during my 10th grade to explore web development. Built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, it includes multiple pages like a blog homepage, individual post pages, and a "Contact Us" form. This project demonstrates fundamental web design and development concepts.
