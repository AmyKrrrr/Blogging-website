# Blogging Website

This is a simple blogging website I created during my 10th grade. It showcases my early web development skills using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. The site consists of multiple subpages, including a "Contact Us" form to demonstrate basic interactivity.

## Features

- **Homepage**: Displays an overview of the blog.
- **Blog Posts**: Separate pages for individual blog posts.
- **About Us**: Provides information about the website or the creator.
- **Contact Us**: A functional form where users can submit their details and messages.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using Bootstrap for mobile-friendly and responsive layout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and pre-built components.
